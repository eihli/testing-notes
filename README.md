# Notes

## Benefits of functional programming

We've talked a lot about the benefits of functional programming.
Value taken in
Value given out
Easy to test
Easy to think about
No state to mess stuff up

But a world without state is a pretty useless world.
We need our programs to do something we can see.

There goes all of the benefits of functional programming.

# Integration Tests Are A Scam

- TDD is primarily a design technique
- Finds design problems
  - If collaboration tests are hard to write, design is flawed
  - Your subjects are too coupled
  - Interactions too complicated
  - Need more abstractions
  - Interfaces too complicated
  - This forces better design
    - This forces fewer defects
      - Virtuous cycle

# Boundaries

## Test Doubles

## Scaling Tests

### Path Count

- If you have N conditionals in your branches, you have 2^N paths
- 500 conditionals in your program -> 150 digit number of paths

### Suite Runtime

- Every time you add test or code, it's in pairs
- Tests run linearly slower
- Code added slows down tests linearly also

## Values

`describe "+"`

- Nothing to isolate test from
- Easy to test in isolation
- Takes a value and returns a value
  - Not mutating anything
  - No dependencies

### Natural Isolation

- Value in -> Value out
- No dependencies

## Paradigms

### Procedural

- Yes Mutation
- Separate Data & Code

```ruby
def feeding_time
  walruses.each do |walrus|
    walrus.stomach << Cheese.new
  end
end
```

You know this is destructive. Each does not do anything if it is not destructive.
This is procedural. You know a walrus has a stomach. You know you can shovel things into the stomach.

### OO

- Yes Mutation
- Combined Data & Code

```ruby
def feeding_time
  walruses.each do |walrus|
    walrus.eat(Cheese.new)
  end
end

class Walrus
  def eat(food)
    @stomach << food
  end
end
```

Very similar to procedural but we hide the internals.

### Functional

- No Mutation
- Separate Data & Code

```ruby
def feeding_time
  walruses.map do |walrus|
    eat(walrus, "cheese")
  end
end

def eat(walrus, food)
  stomach = walrus.fetch(:stomach) + [food]
  walrus.merge(:stomach => stomach)
end
```

### Faux O

- No Mutation
- Combined Data & Code

```ruby
def feeding_time
  walruses.map do |walrus|
    walrus.eat(Cheese.new)
  end
end

class Walrus
  def eat
    Walrus.new(@name, @stomach + [food])
  end
end
```

Can't really build a system this way because it doesn't mutate. Can't touch a screen, can't touch a disk, etc...

## How to compose?

User DB - Expired Users - Mailer

```
class ExpiredUsers
  def self.for_users(users)
    users.select do |user|
      user.active? && user.paid_at < 1.month.ago
    end
  end
end

class Sweeper
  def self.sweep
    ExpiredUsers.for_users(User.all).each do |user|
      UserMailer.billing_problem(user)
    end
  end
end
```

Fundamental distictions

- ExpiredUsers makes all the decisions
- Sweeper contains all the dependencies

FunctionalCore

- Lots of paths
- Few to no dependencies
- Isolated

ImperativeShell

- Lots of dependencies
- Very few paths
- Integrated

Little functional pieces in the middle
Loop of imperative code that isolates them from the outside world/state

## Nice things that happen when you do this

### Concurrency - Actor model

```
queue = Queue.new
Thread.new { loop { queue.push(gets) } }
Thread.new { loop { puts(queue.pop) } }.join
```

Every value in your system is a possible message between the actors.

The Value is the Boundary

### Convert an inherently single threaded system to a system that is naturally parallel

This is easy to do because we have these values, like the `user` value, to push around a system.

```
def sweep
  expired_users(User.all).each do |user|
    notify_of_billing_problem(user)
  end
end
```

```
actor Sweeper
  User.all.each { |user| ExpiredUsers.push(user) }
  die
end
```

```
def expired_users(users)
  users.select do |user|
    user.active? && user.paid_at < 1.month.ago
  end
end
```

```
actor ExpiredUsers
  user = pop
  late = user.active? && user.paid_at < 1.month.ago
  BillingProblemNotification.push(user) if late
end
```

```
def notify_of_billing_problem(user)
  UserMailer.billing_problem(user)
end
```

```
actor BillingProblemNotification
  UserMailer.billing_problem(pop)
end
```

Values *afford* shifting boundaries.

#### Sweeper

##### User Value

#### Expired Users

##### User Value

#### Mailer

### Conclusion

- Easy Testing
- Fast tests
- No call boundary risks (You're not stubbing and mocking)
  - Your boundaries happen to be values, but you're using REAL values in your tests so you know that you're calling methods that actually exist.
- Concurrency gets easier
- Higher code mobility
